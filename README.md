# Python-9-way-puzzle-I was required to create a program for my artificial intelligence class and this is what I chose; a puzzle made with python. 
it's a game where you only get to move up, down, left or right by one puzzle piece depending on the location of the blank
the objective is to arrange the tiles in ascending order: 123-456-78. 
achieve the objective in the shortest numer of moves you can and as fast as you can
